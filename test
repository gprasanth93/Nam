How We Scaled PostgreSQL Time-Series Monitoring with TimescaleDB and WebSockets in PgMaker

📅 May 2025 – Engineering Blog

⸻

🧩 Introduction

As part of PgMaker’s vision to simplify and scale database deployment on KVM infrastructure, we recently rolled out a centralized time-series monitoring service built on TimescaleDB. This system captures live metrics from every KVM VM via WebSocket and pipes it into a single scalable PostgreSQL hypertable. The results? A seamless monitoring experience in Grafana and a foundation for intelligent KVM resource management.

📡 Real-Time Data via WebSockets

Every KVM spun up by PgMaker is configured to stream system statistics to a central service over WebSocket every 2 minutes. These metrics include:
	•	Total Memory
	•	Used Memory %
	•	CPU Used %
	•	Disk & Swap Used %
	•	dbState (e.g., PRIMARY, STANDBY, UNHEALTHY)
	•	supervisorState flags

Each KVM sends a structured JSON packet containing its identity and system usage. The backend listens concurrently to over 200 active WebSocket streams per host using lightweight Node.js services, efficiently inserting them into a TimescaleDB hypertable.

🧠 Why TimescaleDB?

TimescaleDB, built on PostgreSQL, is purpose-built for time-series workloads. Some of its key benefits for our use case include:
	•	✅ Efficient ingestion at scale (handles tens of millions of rows without breaking a sweat)
	•	✅ Powerful time-window queries for alerts, summaries, and dashboards
	•	✅ Native PostgreSQL compatibility, making integration and tooling dead simple
	•	✅ Hypertables for auto-partitioning and time-indexing
	•	✅ Seamless integration with Grafana for real-time visualization

With TimescaleDB, we didn’t need to change our database stack — just enhanced it for time-awareness.

📊 Scaling: How Much Data Are We Managing?

Let’s do some back-of-the-envelope math:
	•	🔄 Every KVM sends a record every 2 mins
	•	📦 Each metric insert = 1 row
	•	🧱 200 KVMs per host
	•	🌍 15 hosts currently online

🧮 Daily Volume:

200 KVMs x 15 hosts = 3000 VMs
Every 2 mins → 30 inserts/hour → 720 inserts/day

3000 VMs × 720 = 2,160,000 rows/day

📈 Monthly:

~65 million rows/month in a single hypertable

Thanks to TimescaleDB’s automatic chunking and PostgreSQL-native indexing, we handle this load with sub-second query latency.

📉 Visualization with Grafana

Our Grafana dashboards are powered directly by TimescaleDB queries. Using dashboard variables, we built filters for:
	•	Region (UK, US, HK)
	•	dbName or Hostname
	•	Time range
	•	Metric type (CPU, Memory, Disk, etc.)

Panels display:
	•	Live stats per KVM
	•	Historical graphs (last 24h, 7d)
	•	Heatmaps of unhealthy states

The best part? We query one unified hypertable, and the dashboard can switch between regions using dynamic data source variables.

🔭 What’s Next?

This architecture lays the groundwork for intelligent, adaptive infrastructure.

🚀 Upcoming Enhancements:
	•	🧠 Auto-scaling recommendations: Predict KVM size upgrades/downgrades based on historical trends.
	•	📈 Anomaly detection: Flag KVMs with unusual CPU/memory patterns.
	•	🔔 Alerting pipelines: Notify teams of degraded or unhealthy KVMs using Timescale query triggers or Grafana alerts.
	•	💾 Retention tuning: Optimize disk via retention policies, offloading stale data to S3 or Glacier.

⸻

🤖 Future: Autonomous KVM Tuning?

Imagine:
	•	A small KVM starts hitting 80% memory regularly.
	•	Our system detects it.
	•	PgMaker provisions a larger KVM and auto-promotes.

We’re building the foundation to let metrics not just inform us — but automate our infrastructure.

🧩 Summary

Component	Stack Used
Ingestion	Node.js + WebSockets
Time-series DB	PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB
Dashboarding	Grafana + PostgreSQL plugin
Scale	~2M rows/day, growing monthly
Storage	Single hypertable w/ chunking

🧠 Takeaway

With TimescaleDB and WebSockets, we built a lightweight, scalable, and future-proof monitoring solution that empowers our KVM database infrastructure to be observable, adaptable, and soon — self-optimizing.

Let the metrics guide us. 🚀
