Introducing our new series: PgMaker KVM Insights. Over the coming weeks, we’ll walk you through how we’ve architected PgMaker to provision PostgreSQL databases inside KVM virtual machines—combining enterprise-grade reliability with developer-friendly agility. In this inaugural post, we’ll cover the big picture: why KVM, how it works at a high level, and what this means for you.

The “Why” Behind KVM-Powered Databases
Guaranteed Resource Isolation
Every database gets its own VM caged with strict CPU, memory, and disk quotas. That means no more “noisy neighbor” incidents—your workloads stay predictable, even when someone else runs a heavy report.

Optimized Utilization
Virtualization lets us consolidate more databases onto fewer hosts without letting them step on each other’s toes. You only reserve—and pay for—the resources you actually need.

Built-In Lifecycle Management
Creating a VM clone, rolling back to a snapshot, or pausing an idle instance is part of the standard KVM toolkit. We’ve baked those capabilities straight into PgMaker, so backups and restores feel as natural as clicking a button.

Stronger Security Posture
Running each database in its own VM adds an extra containment layer. Even if one instance encounters a vulnerability, the others remain insulated.

PgMaker + KVM: At a Glance
Golden VM Templates
Our team maintains hardened images preloaded with your choice of PostgreSQL version, extensions, and optimized OS settings.

Automated Provisioning
When you request a new database, PgMaker’s control plane instructs our KVM orchestrator to spin up a fresh VM, configure storage paths, inject your credentials, and register it with our network fabric.

Seamless Networking
Each VM receives a dedicated virtual NIC that’s automatically whitelisted in pg_hba.conf and our firewall. Connection details appear instantly in your PgMaker dashboard.

On-the-Fly Scaling
Need more RAM, CPU, or IOPS? Adjust your VM’s resource allocation live. We’ll migrate it in the background with zero downtime.

Centralized Monitoring
All VM and database metrics stream into a unified dashboard—so you always have full visibility into performance and capacity.

What’s Changing (Effective This Friday)
Default to KVM
As of Friday, all new PgMaker database requests will spin up KVM-based instances by default.

Bare-Metal by Exception
If your workload truly needs a bare-metal machine—say, for custom hardware, regulatory constraints, or ultra-low latency—please open a support ticket. In your request, let us know:

Why KVM doesn’t meet your requirements

Which bare-metal features you need

We’ll review and work with you to find the right solution.
