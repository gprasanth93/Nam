Perfect — adding the **sizing details** will help users understand how we decide their Firecracker VM configuration and build confidence that migrations are resource-appropriate and not random.

Here’s the **revised and complete internal blog post**, updated to include the **sizing explanation**, in a friendly but transparent tone suitable for internal communication or Confluence.

## 🚀 Upcoming Database Migration to KVM Firecracker – What You Need to Know

**Dear PgMaker Users,**

As part of our continuous modernization effort, we’re migrating all PgMaker databases to **Firecracker-based KVM environments**.
This change will make your databases **faster, more secure, and more resource-efficient** — while preserving the same connectivity and management experience you’re used to.

We’ll begin the rollout **next week**, starting with smaller UAT databases, and gradually move through production over the following weeks.

---

### 🔍 Why We’re Moving to Firecracker

Firecracker KVMs are lightweight micro-virtual machines originally designed for high-performance, multi-tenant environments. They bring several key advantages to PgMaker:

* ⚡ **Faster provisioning:** Databases start in seconds, not minutes.
* 🔒 **Stronger isolation:** Each database runs in a fully sandboxed micro-VM.
* ⚙️ **Predictable resource usage:** Dedicated CPU, memory, and IO rate limits prevent noisy-neighbor issues.
* 💾 **Consistent performance:** Controlled disk and memory environments ensure steady query response times.
* ☁️ **Elastic scaling:** Easy to scale up or down as workloads change.

This upgrade enables PgMaker to serve 10,000+ databases reliably across business lines.

### 🗓️ Migration Plan & Timeline

We’ll follow a **phased rollout** to ensure smooth transition, validation, and minimal disruption.

| Phase        | Timeline        | Environment          | Description                                                                                                                      |
| ------------ | --------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Phase 1**  | Next Week       | **UAT**              | We’ll automatically migrate **tiny / low-IO databases** to Firecracker. This helps us validate performance under real workloads. |
| **Phase 2**  | +1 Week         | **Production**       | Rollout of **tiny and small production databases**. These are low-impact workloads with predictable traffic.                     |
| **Phase 3+** | Following Weeks | **All Environments** | Gradual migration of **medium and large databases**, coordinated with each application team for testing and timing.              |

You’ll receive a short notification before your database’s migration window.

### 🧮 How We Decide Firecracker Sizing

Each Firecracker KVM is provisioned using **actual performance data** from our existing monitoring dashboards (CPU, memory, IO rate, and database size).
We classify databases into tiers to ensure fair resource allocation and cost-effective scaling:

| Tier            | Typical Workload         | vCPU | Memory | Disk Space | IO Rate (Sustained) |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | ---- | ------ | ---------- | ------------------- |
| **Tiny (T0)**   | Low traffic / Dev        | 2    | 3 GB   | 80 GB      | 6 MB/s              |
| **Small (T1)**  | Small UAT / low-IO Prod  | 2    | 6 GB   | 160 GB     | 15 MB/s             |
| **Medium (T2)** | Standard Production      | 4    | 12 GB  | 300 GB     | 35 MB/s             |
| **Large (T3)**  | Heavier OLTP / Reporting | 6    | 24 GB  | 600 GB     | 75 MB/s             |
| **XL (T4)**     | High-volume / Critical   | 8    | 48 GB  | 1 TB       | 120 MB/s            |

The PgMaker platform automatically evaluates your database’s **average and peak usage (p95 metrics)** and assigns the right preset with extra headroom.
If usage grows, we can **resize your KVM** without a full migration — simply by adjusting the configuration.

This ensures your database always runs with **just the right amount of compute, memory, and IO bandwidth**, avoiding both over-provisioning and resource starvation.

### 🤝 Working Together During Migration

We’ll partner closely with every application and operations team to make this transition seamless:

* Dedicated **PgMaker engineers** will monitor migrations live.
* **Application owners** will be informed before and after each cutover.
* **Rollback safety** is built-in — if anything looks off, we can instantly revert.
* A **support channel** will be open throughout migration windows for real-time help.

Your quick feedback during the first few days after migration will help us refine sizing and performance tuning for your workloads.

---

### 💡 What You Need to Do

For most users — **no manual action is required**.

All endpoints, credentials, and connection parameters remain identical.
That said:

* Avoid major schema changes or heavy data loads during your scheduled window.
* Report any noticeable latency or error changes via the PgMaker support channel.
* Let us know early if your application has timing or connection-sensitive dependencies.

---

### 🧠 What Happens Behind the Scenes

1. PgMaker creates a new Firecracker KVM with your assigned spec.
2. Your database is **replicated from current VM to the new KVM** using streaming replication.
3. After catching up, the new KVM is **promoted** and becomes your new primary.
4. The old instance remains as a standby until post-migration checks complete.

This process is fully automated and designed for **zero data loss and minimal downtime** (usually under 1 minute).

---

### 📊 Monitoring After Migration

You can continue viewing all key metrics on the familiar **PgMaker Metrics Dashboard**, now enhanced with:

* Faster refresh intervals
* Accurate IO and CPU rate limits per KVM
* Disk utilization and WAL statistics

We’ll also share performance summaries comparing pre- and post-migration results.

---

### 🌱 What’s Next

After completing the tiny and small migrations:

* Medium and large workloads will follow, scheduled with their application owners.
* Automatic Firecracker right-sizing will roll out based on live metrics.
* Improved performance dashboards will display per-tier resource consumption.

Our end goal is a **self-optimizing, scalable PgMaker platform** that can handle thousands of databases reliably and predictably.
