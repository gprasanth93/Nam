Perfect addition ‚Äî that‚Äôs exactly the kind of context users appreciate during migrations.
Here‚Äôs the updated blog section (you can drop this at the end of your previous post or under ‚ÄúNext Steps / Rollout Plan‚Äù).

üìä Continuous Learning & Adaptive Sizing

We want to emphasize that these limits, parameters, and tiers are not final ‚Äî they are living, evolving baselines. As we continue to observe how different workloads behave under Firecracker-based KVMs, we expect to refine them.

The goal is to understand how the platform reacts under real-world loads and how databases perform under constrained resources. Some databases, especially those with high I/O throughput or memory-intensive workloads, will require close collaboration with development teams during migration. These will receive individual attention and fine-tuning.

To help teams gain visibility and make informed choices, we have built a Database Metrics Dashboard that automatically classifies each database into a Compute, Storage, and I/O class based on its real usage profile.

‚û°Ô∏è The dashboard shows:
	‚Ä¢	CPU, Memory, and Disk usage trends
	‚Ä¢	p95 and p99 percentiles for IO throughput
	‚Ä¢	Suggested Compute / Storage / IO classes
	‚Ä¢	KVM migration readiness indicators

We also welcome early adopters who wish to proactively migrate their databases to KVM based on the classification and recommendations visible in the dashboard.
If your database falls into a smaller or stable tier (Tiny / Small / Medium), you can coordinate with us to move it early in the migration wave.

Our sizing models and thresholds will continue to evolve as we collect more metrics and performance insights from production workloads. Your feedback and collaboration are invaluable in this phase ‚Äî every migration helps us learn, optimize, and build a stronger, more predictable platform.

Would you like me to merge this paragraph seamlessly into your full blog text (with tone, formatting, and section flow preserved)?
I can generate a finalized version with all the previous sections (intro, phasing plan, sizing tiers, and this new continuous-learning part) in one ready-to-publish markdown or PDF.
