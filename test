## Executive Summary

2025 was a year of platform hardening and migration enablement for PgMaker. I led the framing and kickoff of our KVM migration program (C0/S0/I0 classes), advanced replication architecture to a simpler and more scalable model (single exposed port on the bare‑metal host routing to the active primary KVM), rolled out TimescaleDB‑backed metrics and a practical “migration complexity” score, and resolved reliability issues (notably an express‑rate‑limit store bug that surfaced as `totalHits` undefined). These delivered safer migrations, clearer decisioning, and fewer production foot‑guns for our internal customers.

## Key Outcomes & Impact (Top 10)

1. **KVM Migration Program (C0/S0/I0) — defined & launched.**

   * Drove the classification model and migration approach for 214 databases across regions (UK 131, HK 30, US 53).
   * Authored comms, runbooks, and a **standby‑first** migration plan to minimize downtime and risk.
   * **Impact:** Shared language and sequencing for stakeholders; faster, safer execution windows.

2. **First migration waves planned and coordinated (HK focus).**

   * Structured UAT → PRD cadence with clearly communicated 10:00 EDT windows and standby‑then‑primary cutovers.
   * **Impact:** Predictable change windows; reduced operational stress during cutovers.

3. **Replication architecture simplified for scale.**

   * Standardized on **single exposed port** on bare‑metal host to route standby replication traffic to the active primary KVM; aligned on doing essential installs on the host for a clean, maintainable solution.
   * **Impact:** Less toil for failovers/switchover; clearer networking; easier audits.

4. **TimescaleDB metrics in place for PgMaker.**

   * Operationalized a TimescaleDB setup for time‑series DB metrics to support capacity planning and SLO tracking.
   * **Impact:** Queryable history for throughput/lag; more objective go/no‑go calls for migrations.

5. **Migration “Complexity Score” dashboard.**

   * Built a dashboard to classify DBs by complexity to migrate; renamed user‑facing “Health” to **Complexity** for clarity (five levels from *Easy* → *Extremely Complex*).
   * **Impact:** Transparent, data‑driven prioritization and expectation management.

6. **Stability fix: express‑rate‑limit regression.**

   * Diagnosed a production instability caused by a custom memory store (undefined `totalHits`); restored reliability by reverting to the default memory store (v7.4.1).
   * **Impact:** Eliminated noisy errors and blocked requests; improved platform trust.

7. **Frontend simplification for faster delivery.**

   * Merged `frontend/src/` into project root `src/` to simplify build/deploy and cut path confusion.
   * **Impact:** Cleaner CI, fewer build surprises, easier onboarding.

8. **Reverse‑proxy/vite troubleshooting and hardening.**

   * Investigated gateway timeouts and clarified relative pathing and env‑specific reverse proxy setup to align local and env behaviours.
   * **Impact:** Better dev→UAT parity; fewer “works on my machine” failures.

9. **Runbook & blog content to scale migrations.**

   * Authored internal posts on KVM classes, downtime expectations, and sequencing; improved change comms quality.
   * **Impact:** Reduced ticket noise; stakeholders felt prepared for change windows.

10. **Operational guardrails & controls uplift.**

    * Reinforced WAL/replication practices, logging conventions, and rate‑limit protections; continued to standardize configs.
    * **Impact:** Lower risk posture; faster incident triage.

| **O4: Simplify replication topology**       | Adopt single‑port routing on bare‑metal host; document failover steps; socialize pattern.                | **On track**  |
| **O5: Reduce build/deploy friction**        | Flatten frontend structure; document reverse proxy patterns for env parity.                              | **Completed** |

> **Note:** I’ve intentionally avoided inserting unverifiable numeric KPIs here; happy to add precise counts (e.g., migrations completed, error reductions, p95 latencies) from logs upon request.

## Leadership & Collaboration

* Partnered with infra/networking to align on host‑level installs and port routing strategy.
* Coordinated across regions (HK, UK, US) to align migration sequencing and downtime comms.
* Drove crisp change documentation and set expectations ahead of windows to reduce escalations.

---

## Innovation & Continuous Improvement

* Advanced **Complexity‑based** migration triage to focus effort where it matters most.
* Explored ideas for a distributed artifact service ("DAWN") and continued to evaluate Rust vs Node trade‑offs for high‑throughput brokers (ongoing discovery).
* Codified common proxy and build pitfalls into checklists to cut repeat issues.

---

## Customer Impact

* Fewer failed requests from rate‑limit store issues; clearer migration comms lowered user anxiety.
* Better visibility into readiness via metrics and the complexity dashboard; customers know what to expect.

---

## Learning & Growth

* Deepened expertise in PostgreSQL replication patterns (primary/async standbys, failover playbooks).
* Hands‑on with TimescaleDB hypertables for observability; improved Node.js 22 practices.
* Strengthened change management and stakeholder comms through multiple migration dry‑runs.

---

## What Didn’t Go Perfectly & How I Addressed It

* **Custom rate‑limit store** introduced instability → rolled back quickly; captured lessons learned and added a guardrail to avoid similar regressions.
* **Proxy pathing and timeouts** surfaced late in UAT → tightened documentation and added env‑parity checks to our deployment checklist.

## 2026 Goals (Draft)

1. **Complete multi‑region KVM migrations** with zero‑surprise change windows and clear blast‑radius controls.
2. **Automated switchover/failover** with health‑gated routing and minimal human intervention.
3. **SLOs & Error Budgets** for PgMaker surfaces; integrate with alerting and on‑call.
4. **Blue/Green DB upgrades** for extension and major‑version changes with predictable downtime.
5. **Cost/performance telemetry** for right‑sizing and cloud/host capacity planning.
6. **Chaos & DR drills**: regular failover exercises; evidence packs for audits.

## Support Needed

* **Resourcing:** Dedicated cycles for migration tooling (automation + dashboards) to accelerate remaining regions.
* **Environments:** Stable UAT capacity to run realistic load during cutovers.
* **Cross‑team alignment:** Early coordination with security/networking for host‑level patterns (ports, firewall rules, observability agents).
