1. **PgMaker Master Lab (hands-on).**
   Ran a hands-on coding workshop introducing PgMaker internals and workflows; ~30 cross-function staff joined and left able to self-serve common tasks.

2. **XLT Sharing Session (pg_notify rotation).**
   Presented new PgMaker features, including pg_notify-based password rotation that removes HTTP loops and improves reliability/latency.

3. **Pune-wide MSS IT Open Mic.**
   Hosted an open forum (~150 attendees) to demo PgMaker, field Q&A, and accelerate onboarding; several new teams engaged afterward.

4. **New-team onboarding (FICC, SmartServe, others).**
   Partnered on requirements, built integrations, and successfully onboarded new clients to the PgMaker platform with clear runbooks.

5. **Databases on KVM—design & tooling.**
   Designed, coded, tested, and rolled out KVM database architecture with SSH access, reverse proxy, WebSocket sidecar, and fast rebuild tooling; documented and communicated the pattern.

6. **First dev rollouts on KVM.**
   Launched the initial dev wave on KVM with zero failures; enabled per-database custom KVM sizing to match cost/performance needs.

7. **KVM stress testing & first prod moves.**
   Validated KVM under high IO/RAM workloads and executed the first production migrations of heavy databases, providing flexibility to tune KVM and PostgreSQL configs safely.

8. **TimescaleDB observability pipeline.**
   Implemented a new metrics backbone with TimescaleDB (>3M records/day) to unlock historical analysis, capacity planning, and SLO tracking.

9. **Grafana dashboards for KVM & Postgres.**
   Delivered node- and DB-level dashboards (CPU, memory, IO, disk, connections, lag) that give teams a clear, real-time view of performance.

10. **MasterLab Toronto—instructor.**
    Led a 3-day in-person coding series on MuServer, Cranker, and PgMaker, accelerating ramp-up for new engineers.

11. **KVM Classes (cloud-style bucketing).**
    Introduced standardized KVM class buckets to categorize resource profiles, simplifying sizing decisions and migrations.

12. **Database-Profile site (load insights).**
    Built a web app that visualizes IO/MEM/CPU/connection profiles and recommends the best-fit KVM class for each database.

13. **Auto-migration analysis & stakeholder comms.**
    Kicked off bulk auto-migration to KVM and coordinated with product teams to move larger DBs, aligning on resource management and operational guardrails.

### Future Plans (concise)

* **Smarter KVM buckets & alerting.**
  Refine class thresholds using historical trends; add SLO-based alerts and proactive recommendations.
* **Auto right-sizing.**
  Continuously suggest (and optionally schedule) KVM upgrades/downgrades based on real usage, seasonality, and error budgets.
* **Platform expansion (PGaaS).**
  Deliver a provider-style service offering PgMaker-like UX across multiple venues (Kubernetes, GCP, DHP) with the same APIs and guardrails.
