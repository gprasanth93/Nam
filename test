Dear DB Owners,

As part of our ongoing effort to make the platform more reliable and achieve better control over resource allocation across hosts, we have started migrating databases to the KVM environment.

As a head start, we are automatically migrating smaller and low-resource databases to KVM. However, as we move forward, we also need to carefully assess the larger and more resource-intensive databases, as they have a significant impact on overall platform capacity.

Below are 42 databases that require closer review before migration. These databases deviate from the KVM classes currently defined and will need a database developer’s input to assess how they can be optimized and migrated — ensuring they fit within no more than C5/S5/I4 resource thresholds.

Your cooperation and analysis will help us make this migration smooth and sustainable for all environments.
