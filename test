write an blog about performance comparison on Sync vs async replication of postres where Sync was quorum based replication with setting of ANY 1 and all the there were 3 warm standbys 

Test scenarios
	1.	single operation with block of bulk inserts of 50000 record of total 1million records 
	2.	3 parallel operations with block of bulk inserts on each table with 50000 record of total 1million records on each table 

In the both the test cases columns in table was 100 and Alphanumerical values with 100 length in each column

Results

synch was performant with test 1  took 25.30 mins to insert total 1 million records where as asynchronous took 26.37 minutes to insert 1 million records 

asynchronous replication was performant on test 2, synch took 1:05:03 hr for table1 to insert 1 million records, 1:03:03 hr for table2 to insert 1 million records and 1:02:55 hr for table3 to insert 1 million records. Asych took 46:44 minutes for table1 to insert 1 million records, 44:43 minutes for table2 to insert 1 million records and 45:03 minutes for table3 to insert 1 million records

Write a blog in simple and professional English on above observation and also calculate the approximate size in megabytes and mention the amount of data generated and shipped in both the cases.





Title: Navigating the Tides of PostgreSQL Replication: A Sync vs. Async Odyssey

In the ever-evolving landscape of database management, the choice between synchronous and asynchronous replication can be a crucial factor influencing performance. Our expedition into PostgreSQL's quorum-based synchronous replication, specifically with an 'ANY 1' setting, unraveled intriguing insights through two distinct test scenarios.

**Test Scenario 1: The Lone Crusade of Sync**

Sync, the valiant lone warrior, showcased its mettle in a single-operation bulk insert, triumphantly inserting 1 million records in a brisk 25.30 minutes. In this solitary feat, synchronous replication proved itself a formidable contender, narrowly outpacing its asynchronous counterpart, which took 26.37 minutes to complete the same task.

**Test Scenario 2: Async's Ballet of Parallel Operations**

The stage was set for a grand performance in our second scenario—three parallel operations, each involving the bulk insertion of 1 million records across tables. Here, the asynchronous replication took center stage. It gracefully waltzed through the challenge, requiring only 46:44 minutes for table1, 44:43 minutes for table2, and 45:03 minutes for table3 to complete their respective million-record inserts. In contrast, sync struggled to maintain the rhythm, with times of 1:05:03 hours, 1:03:03 hours, and 1:02:55 hours for the same tables.

*Fun Fact Interlude*: Did you know that asynchronous replication completed the insertion across three tables in less time than synchronous replication took for just one? A dazzling performance indeed!

**Data Size in the Spotlight:**

In both scenarios, our tables boasted 100 columns filled with alphanumerical values, each 100 characters long. Crunching the numbers, we estimated the size of the data generated.

**Data Size Calculation:**

1 record ≈ 100 columns * 100 characters = 10,000 characters
1 million records = 10,000,000,000 characters

*Approximate Size in Megabytes:*

Assuming an average character size of 1 byte, the total size reached approximately 10 GB.

**Shipping the Data:**

When it came to the transmission of this colossal data, asynchronous replication emerged as the swift messenger. Completing the task in a mere 45:03 minutes, it demonstrated not only speed but also efficiency. In contrast, synchronous replication, despite its prowess, took considerably more time to dispatch the same amount of data, requiring over an hour for each table.

In conclusion, the choice between synchronous and asynchronous replication is akin to selecting the lead performer for a grand symphony. While synchronous replication excels in solo acts, asynchronous replication steals the show in the graceful coordination of parallel endeavors. As you navigate the seas of database management, these insights can guide you in choosing the right rhythm for your data orchestration.
